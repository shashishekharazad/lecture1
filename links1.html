		‘Branching’ is a feature of Git that allows a project to move in multiple different directions simultaneously. There is one master branch that is always usable, but any number of new branches can be created to develop new features. Once ready, these branches can then be merged back into master .
		When working in a Git repository, HEAD refers to the current branch being worked on. When a different branch is ‘checked out’ , the HEAD changes to indicate the new working branch.
		When merging a branch back into master , there is the possibility for merge conicts to arise. These can be resolved in the same way discussed in Lecture 0.
